# algos
Little book of Algos in python, go, and rust.

### Goal and Purpose
Enjoyment and investment in time to both python and go. Adding either A. my own code to algorithms that already exist and then refine them for my personal knowledge, and B. Add codified algorithms to this repo for reasons of exploration.

This will grow over time, in the interim feel freem to send me an email tliakos@gmail.com if you want to add your twist on it.


### Note
Any code, scripts that I reuse directly will be noted inside of comments referenced at head of file. 


Enjoy.
